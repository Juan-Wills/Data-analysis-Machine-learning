"""
Numpy (Numerical Python) is used for better numerical computing in python.

Some tools numpy provide:
    1. Array-oriented arithmetic operations with broadcasting capabilities
    2. Multidimentional arrays
    3. Eficient and fast mathematical functions
    4. Reading/writting array data to disk
    5. Linear algebra, random number generator, and Fourier
       transform capabilities
    6. C API for connecting Numpy with libraries written in C,
       C++, or FORTRAN

Data analysis applications:
   1. Fast data munging and cleaning, subsetting and filtering,
      transforming, among others kind of operations  
   2. Array algorithms like sorting, unique, and set operations
   3. Descriptive statistics and aggregating/summarizing data
   4. Data alignment for merging and joining heterogenous datasets
   5. Expressing conditional logic as array expressions instead of
      python 'for' loops
   6. Group-wise data manipulation
